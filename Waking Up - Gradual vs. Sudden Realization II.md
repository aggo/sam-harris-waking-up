At a certain point in our discussions with Tulku Urgyen's Rinpoche, our Swiss prodigy declared her boundless freedom in terms similar to those she had used to such great effect with Poonjaji. After a few highly amusing exchanges during which we watched Tulku Urgyen's struggle to understand what our translator was telling him, he gave a short laugh and looked the woman over with renewed interest.

"- How long has it been since you were last lost in thought?" he asked
"- I haven't had any thoughts for over a week", the woman replied.
Tulku Urgyen's smiled:
"- A week."
"- Yes, no thoughts. No, my mind is completely still. It's just pure consciousness."
"- That's very interesting. Okay, so this is what's going to happen now. We're all going to wait for you to have your next thought. There's no hurry. We're all very patient people. We're just going to sit here and wait. So, please tell us when you notice a thought arise in your mind."

It is difficult to convey what a brilliant and subtle intervention this was.

It may have been the most inspired moment of teaching I have ever witnessed. After a few moments, a look of doubt appear on our friend's face. "Okay, wait a minute. Oh, that could have been a thought there. Okay."

Over the next 30 seconds, we watched this woman's enlightenment completely unravel. It became clear that she had been merely thinking about how expansive her experience of consciousness had become, how it was perfectly free of thought, immaculate, just that space. Without noticing that she was thinking incessantly she had been telling herself the story of her enlightenment and she had been getting away with it because she happened to be an extraordinarily happy person for whom everything was going well for the time being This was the danger of non-dual teachings of the sort that Poonjaji was handing out to all comers. It was easy to delude oneself into thinking that one had achieved a permanent breakthrough, especially because he insisted that all breakthroughs must be permanent. What the Dzogchen teachings made clear, however, is that thinking about what is beyond thought is still thinking and a glimpse of selflessness is generally only the beginning of a process that must reach fruition.

Being able to stand perfectly free of the feeling of self is the start of one's spiritual journey, not the end. I will read one more section here because this will give you more context for how I think about meditation. So next section here titled Dzogchen - taking the goal as the path.

"Tulku Urgyen lived in a hermitage on the southern slope of Shiva pouring mountain overlooking Katmandu Valley. He spent more than 20 years of his life on formal retreat and was deservedly famous for the clarity with which he gave the "pointing out" instruction of Dzogchen, a formal initiation in which a teacher seeks to impart the experience of self-transcendence directly to a student.

I receive this teaching from several Dzogchen masters but I never met anyone who spoke about the nature of consciousness as precisely as Tulku Urgyen. In the last five years of his life, I made several trips to Nepal to study with him. The practice of Dzogchen requires that one be able to experience the intrinsic selflessness of awareness in every moment, that is when one is not otherwise distracted by thought.

Which is to say that for a Dzogchen meditator, mindfulness must be synonymous with dispelling the illusion of the self. Rather than teach a technique of meditation such as paying close attention to once breathing, a Dzogchen master must precipitate an insight on the basis of which a student can thereafter practice a form of awareness, the Tibetan term is Rigpa, that is unencumbered by subject object dualism.

Thus it is often said in Dzogchen that one "takes the goal as the path", because the freedom from self the one might otherwise seek is the very thing that one practices. The goal of Dzogchen, if one can call it such, is to grow increasingly familiar with this way of being in the world.

In my experience, some Dzogchen masters are better teachers than others. I've been in the presence of several of the most revered Tibetan llamas of our time, while they were ostensibly teaching Dzogchen and most of them simply describe this view of consciousness without giving clear instructions on how to glimpse it.

The genius of Tulku Urgyen was that he could point out the nature of mind with the precision and matter of factness of teaching a person how to thread a needle and could get an ordinary meditator like me to recognize that consciousness is intrinsically free of self. There might be some initial struggle and uncertainty, depending on the student, but once the truth of non-duality had been glimpsed it became obvious that it was always available and there was never any doubt about how to see it again. I came to Tulku Urgyen yearning for the experience of self-transcendence and in a few minutes he showed me that I had no self to transcend.

In my view, there's nothing supernatural or even mysterious about this transmission of wisdom from master to disciple. Tulku Urgyen's affect on me came purely from the clarity of his teaching. As it is with any challenging endeavor, the difference between being utterly misled by false information, being nudged in the general direction and being precisely guided by an expert is difficult to overstate.

The direct perception of the optic blind spot provides a useful analogy. Imagine that perceiving the blind spot will completely transform a person's life. Next imagine that whole religions, such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam, are predicated on the denial of the blind spots existence. Let us say that their central doctrines assert the perfect uniformity of the visual field.

Perhaps other traditions acknowledge the blind spot but purely in political terms, without giving any clear indication of how to recognize it. A few lineages may actually teach techniques whereby one can see the blind spot for oneself, but only gradually, after months and years of effort and even then one's glimpses of it will seem more matter of luck than anything else.

In a more esoteric tradition still, a “blind spot master” gives the “pointing-out instruction” but without much precision: Perhaps he tells you to close one eye, for reasons that are never made explicit, and then says that the spot you seek is right on the surface of your vision. No doubt some people will succeed in discovering the blind spot under these conditions, but the teacher could certainly be clearer than this. How much clearer? If Tulku Urgyen had been pointing out the blind spot, he would have produced a figure like the one below and given these instructions:

1. Hold this figure in front of you at arms length.
2. Close your left eye and stare at the cross with your right.
3. Gradually move the page closer to your face while keeping your gaze fixed on the cross.
4. Notice when the dot on the right disappears.
5. Once you find your blind spot, continue to experiment with this figure by moving the page back and forth until any possibility of doubt about the existence of the blind spot has disappeared.

It is considered bad form in most spiritual circles, especially among Buddhists, to make claims about ones own realization. However, I think this taboo comes at a high price, because it allows people to remain confused about how to practice. So I will describe my experience plainly.
Before meeting Tulku Urgyen, I had spent at least a year practicing vipassana on silent retreats. The experience of self-transcendence was not entirely unknown to me. I could remember moments when the distance between the observer and the observed had seemed to vanish, but I viewed these experiences as being dependent on conditions of extreme mental concentration. Consequently, I thought they were unavailable in more ordinary moments, outside intensive retreat. But after a few minutes, Tulku Urgyen simply handed me the ability to cut through the illusion of the self direcdy, even in ordinary states of consciousness. This instruction was, without question, the most important thing I have ever been explicitly taught
by another human being. It has given me a way to escape the usual tides of psychological suffering—fear, anger, shame— in an instant. At my level of practice, this freedom lasts only a few moments. But these moments can be repeated, and they can grow in duration. Punctuating ordinary experience in this way makes all the difference. In fact, when I pay attention, it is impossible for me to feel like a self at all: The implied center of cognition and emotion simply falls away, and it is obvious that consciousness is never truly
confined by what it knows. That which is aware of sadness is not sad. That which is aware of fear is not fearful. The moment I am lost in thought, however, I’m as confused as anyone else.

Given this change in my perception of the world, I understand the attractions of traditional spirituality. I also recognize the needless confusion and harm that inevitably arise from the doctrines of faith-based religion. I did not have to believe anything irrational about the universe, or about my place within it, to learn the practice of Dzogchen.
I didn’t have to accept Tibetan Buddhist beliefs about karma and rebirth or imagine that Tulku Urgyen or the other meditation masters I met possessed magic powers. And whatever the traditional liabilities of the guru-devotee relationship, I know from direct experience that it is possible to meet a teacher who can deliver the goods."

Okay, so that's the end of my reading. So that's how I come to the practice of meditation. And after I spent the decades at my twenties largely focused on meditation, as well as reading the relevant Eastern and Western philosophy, I decided to go back to school because I was writing non-fiction about the nature of the mind.

Happily I had dropped out of Stanford University where you can never really drop out. I think Stanford is one of the few schools in the United States that has the policy of never making you reapply. So I just showed up like some wrip-fan winkle character after 11 years away.

And finished my degree in philosophy. And then went on to do a PhD in neuroscience at UCLA. So I bring a philosophical and scientific and secular perspective to meditation. Ultimately, I think we should all be practicing non-dual mindfulness without believing any bullshit. That is a human future worth wanting. And that's what I'm attempting to equip people to do in the waking up course.
