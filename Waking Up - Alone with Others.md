Okay, so this lesson is an exercise for practicing in public. And to do this you need to find some place in public where you can sit comfortably and then watch people come and go in a way that's unobtrusive. So you might be sitting on a park bench or in a cafe or in an airport, any place where you can sit and be undistracted and just observe the comings and goings of other people without being thought a psychopath.

These need to be people at some distance from you, a street scene, people walking past you in the park, moving about the terminal in an airport, some public place where you won't seem too odd just looking into the distance and seeing people. And as always, get comfortable, sit more or less with your spine erect.

And simply stare into space. And keep your vision as relaxed and as wide as possible. And then just watch as people come and go in your visual field. You can listen to sounds. And feel the sensations in your body. But privilege vision as your primary sense here, as people walk toward you and away from you.

Notice the feeling of being located in space. Does it feel like they're walking toward something or away from something? As someone comes toward you, notice the sensation of being approached. What is it that they're walking towards? Again, keep your vision very wide and relaxed. Don't fixate on the particulars of the people around you.

Just observe this feeling of being in relationship to others. And being implicated by their gaze or potentially implicated by their gaze. Notice this feeling of being a potential object for others in the world. Now this feeling will be heightened if someone actually makes eye contact with you, of course.

There's no need to be a weirdo and stare at them intently, you can look away but notice the feeling that anchors you here the seems to define you. This is the feeling that you call "I". This is the feeling that you exist as a subject behind your face, behind your eyes, this is the feeling of being a self.

And this is the self that is an illusion. And which can be discovered as such. It's absence can be found and felt. As you watch people come and go in this way. Gently look for yourself. Look for the subject. Look for the one who is seen.

You might actually experiment with walking now. You can get up and walk down the sidewalk or through the park wherever you happen to be. And as you walk again, keep your vision very wide. Just gazing into space. And as others come toward you, look for where it is you think you are.

Where's the one who is being approached? Where is the one who is seen? Your body is simply appearing in consciousness along with the bodies of others. Where are you in this moment?

No matter how much you look, you won't find the subject. There's simply this open space of consciousness, of sights and sounds merely appearing.

Again, pay attention as closely as you can. But as someone is walking toward you or coming into your field of view and then leaving it, look for yourself. Look for the subject. Look for the experiencer behind your face who is appropriating experience in each moment. Look for the center of consciousness.

As you develop stronger powers of mindfulness and concentration and grow more sensitive to what there is to be noticed here, you might find that in this first instant of looking for yourself, the moment you attempt to turn attention upon itself, there's this break in the sense of being located.

Where perhaps for the briefest of moments, the person walking toward you for a step or two is clearly seen and yet is no longer felt to be walking toward anyone or anything. Rather what you experience in that moment is simply the world as a kind of seamless hole. Your consciousness is just the space in which sights and sounds and sensations are appearing. That includes the sight of your body and the sensations associated with walking or sitting. And there's no you in the middle of it. The feeling of self, the feeling that others now are approaching you or walking away, the feeling of being located is itself another appearance in consciousness.

And if you look for it, the feeling itself can drop away.

And then for that moment you're no longer on the outside of the world looking in, you're no longer behind your face. So in this moment, as you see people walking toward you or away, look for the one behind your eyes.

And if in that first instant you can see that there is just the world, just consciousness and its contents, rest as that.

And the moment you begin thinking "was that it? is that it?", notice that thought itself arising and passing away in consciousness.
